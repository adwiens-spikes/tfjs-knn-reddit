Excited to be here today to talk about local foods, eating healthy and building local food economies. Let\u2019s talk about anything food related!\n\nOver a decade ago I was featured by Oprah as part of her 80 leaders in training for my, Grow Your Small Market Farm, business planning program for local farmers. [http://www.oprah.com/money/80-leaders-in-training/4](http://www.oprah.com/money/80-leaders-in-training/4)\n\nMy husband and I owned a small organic farm for over a decade and most recently I have been working on a farmer majority owned food manufacturing business called Iowa Choice Harvest ([https://www.iowachoiceharvest.com/](https://www.iowachoiceharvest.com/)). The USDA has told us that we are one of a handful or the only, company in the country that does pick and freeze sweet corn on the same day. Our frozen Iowa fruits and vegetables have no sugar, salt, additives or preservatives, making them a healthy, local choice, year round.\n\nThere are many reasons it\u2019s important to support a fully integrated local food system. Investing in your local food system, by buying local in your retail establishments, through farmers markets or other local ventures keeps dollars spent in your local community. Providing income not only for the farmers, but the processors, distributors and retailers as well. Beyond the benefit of eating healthier food, by supporting local foods you are investing in a local and sustainable economy.\n\nThere continues to be many challenges in creating a sustainable local food system, these include the raising of the crops and livestock, the small batch processing, the distribution of the products to market and the storage of these products. I spent many years working on the farmer side of our local food system, but now with Iowa Choice Harvest we have identified the need for small batch processing. The number of small food processors in the U.S. has dwindled, reducing the number of ways our local farmers have to get their crops to a market other than for fresh. A lack of small food processors also means that new food entrepreneurs struggle to identify processors that can help them sustainably grow their business.  \n\nI would love to answer your questions, ask me anything!\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/jTbNU9c](https://imgur.com/jTbNU9c)", "author_fullname": "t2_j8q9en5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hello Reddit, I\u2019m Penny Brown Huber, local foods expert.

Yes- I have lots of student loans, and yes, buying my books helps me pay off those student loans. Thanks. But more than that-- check my books out from your local library and read about glaciers-- because I believe that with knowing comes caring, and with caring comes hope. I want you to get educated about the ice I love so you start to care about it, because caring is how we solve climate change. \n\n\n\n\n4. What is feminist glaciology? FemG calls attention to the gendered nature of glacier research (and more broadly STEM), the lack of women and diversity in the field, and how this effects what knowledges are produced. Said differently- FemG advocates for greater inclusivity in practices and knowledges (ie: what \"counts\" as glacier research). One of the biggest surprises from my work in Iceland-- you can read about it in my book The Secret Lives of Glaciers-- is how some people profoundly benefited from glacier loss. I only reached that conclusion by the traditional metrics of monitoring/measuring/predicting local glaciers.... AND evaluating local people in glacier research. That's what Feminist Glaciology is.

I apologize for the lengthy description but I just wanted to lay out a framework because the pieces are their own stories as well but it's also all one big experience.\n\n----------\n\nWhen I was a senior in high school I committed a sex offense against a 12 year old girl.  I knew her from school (very small school, 7th - 12th grade combined in one building/study halls, etc).  I don't think specifics are necessary, however there was no physical force, violence (or threat of), used during my offense.\n\nI was initially given a stayed sentence with a little jail time to serve.  With a plea agreement that I'd be on probation for 15 years, and follow all of the terms, which included attending sex offender treatment a long with your typical no substance use, no contact with minors, etc.\n\nAs a stupid (adult) teenager, I didn't know how deep of trouble I had gotten myself into so I didn't take the initial sentencing seriously and when I was released from jail continued to have contact with minors (half my friends were still 17, for example so I justified that being \"ok\") and other things that were violations of my probation agreement like smoking weed.\n\nThis along with my inability to really do any kind of meaningful work during my sessions at sex offender treatment led to an eventual execution of my full 144 month (12 year) sentence.. which was a shock, to say the least.\n\nMy time incarcerated was split almost 50/50 between state run facilities and a private prison.  Both had their ups, both had their downs.  My final 3 years I participated in sex offender treatment in prison, 6 hours a day - 5 days a week.  Some form of group therapy, classes, or individual sessions with a psychologist.\n\nA lot of lights came on for me in treatment and I spent a good deal of time learning about myself and how I've impacted other people and their lifestyles.  I think I really embraced the opportunity to make myself a better person (as much as I could) and still use a lot of the tools I learned in there, in my every day life.\n\nI served 7.5 years (good behavior, time served) and then another 5 years on parole.  Parole and probation are two entirely different things, btw.  Even though I graduated treatment in prison, I was still required to attend treatment when I was released.  I showed them all the work I had done while in prison, and was recommended for aftercare (fast track) to completion. \n\nI had to take polygraphs to prove my written sexual histories didn't contain any more forms of victimization or any other offenses I hadn't admitted to.  As well as to confirm truthfulness in sexual fantasies and attractions, etc.\n\nFinally last year, I was finished with my sentence.  I'm still registered on my states predatory offender registry (and will be, for life) -- but I am officially no longer incarcerated or on supervision.  I even managed to get registered to vote in time for last years midterms.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.\n\n**Feel free to ask me anything!**\n\n------------------------\n**My Proof:** Mods have my proof.\n\n------------------------\n\n**EDIT** Well I've been at this awhile so I'm going to call it.
