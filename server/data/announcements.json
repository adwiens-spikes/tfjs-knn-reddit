You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.\n\n**I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?**\n\nYes!

When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.\n\n* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.\n* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.\n* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.\n* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).\n\nMost (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:\n\n* 3% (4) had negative karma\n* 33% (47) had 0 karma\n* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma\n* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma\n* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma\n\nTo give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:\n\n* [u/emilyward2017](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilyward2017)\n* [u/Homaeefar](https://www.reddit.com/user/Homaeefar)\n* [u/alessia\\_80s](https://www.reddit.com/user/alessia_80s)\n* [u/Anzfp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzfp)\n* [u/jeremybernard](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremybernard)\n* [u/suarezanton](https://www.reddit.com/user/suarezanton)\n\nUnlike our [last post on foreign interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran\u2019s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.\n\nThrough this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we\u2019ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.\n\nWe believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills.

When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3% (4) had negative karma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;33% (47) had 0 karma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;24% (35) had 1-999 karma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;25% (36) had 10,000+ karma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/emilyward2017\"&gt;u/emilyward2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Homaeefar\"&gt;u/Homaeefar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alessia_80s\"&gt;u/alessia_80s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzfp\"&gt;u/Anzfp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremybernard\"&gt;u/jeremybernard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/suarezanton\"&gt;u/suarezanton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/\"&gt;last post on foreign interference&lt;/a&gt;, the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran\u2019s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we\u2019ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We&amp;#39;re investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we\u2019ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dR386yuW6D97X1k4W9ZH3OSQ3T6BZPGN1GwfCXQgAF4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4c12e72264802e1375b0915835e00b3a711ecfff", "width": 400, "height": 400}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dR386yuW6D97X1k4W9ZH3OSQ3T6BZPGN1GwfCXQgAF4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c88ac5b915a43d5454bf71423e06ab46375bfa6", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dR386yuW6D97X1k4W9ZH3OSQ3T6BZPGN1GwfCXQgAF4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adbb6cd94fce718b2d3d6d967ea42e4f50c2b1de", "width": 216, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dR386yuW6D97X1k4W9ZH3OSQ3T6BZPGN1GwfCXQgAF4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea22cf69782f45332c2ad7ca3f66076956c317b2", "width": 320, "height": 320}], "variants": {}, "id": "rYfpuDIZJ1N1EMUrOjo6n4LuVLW0ycJocXppMxF87Qc"}], "enabled": false}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": "admin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ij", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "9bvkqa", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KeyserSosa", "num_crossposts": 22, "num_comments": 5251, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "house_only", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/", "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/", "subreddit_subscribers": 36263508, "created_utc": 1535736365.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "announcements", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit\u2019s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we\u2019ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. \n\n**What happened?**\n\nOn June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees\u2019 accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. \n\nAlthough this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.\n\nNow that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.\n\n**What information was involved?**\n\nSince June 19, we\u2019ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:\n\n* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**\n   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site\u2019s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit\u2019s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.\n   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you\u2019re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you\u2019ve been affected.\n* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**\n   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. \n   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don\u2019t have an email address associated with your account or your \u201cemail digests\u201d user preference was unchecked during that period, you\u2019re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. \n\nAs the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.\n\n**What is Reddit doing about it?**\n\nSome highlights. We:\n\n* Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.\n* Are messaging user accounts if there\u2019s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account\u2019s current password. \n* Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit\u2019s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)\n\n**What can you do?**\n\nFirst, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.\n\nIf your account credentials were affected and there\u2019s a chance the credentials relate to the password you\u2019re currently using on Reddit, we\u2019ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today. \n\nIf your email address was affected, think about whether there\u2019s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn\u2019t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this [help page](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data).\n\nAnd, as in all things, a strong unique password and [enabling 2FA](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) (which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.", "author_fullname": "t2_1wjm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 4, "clicked": false, "title": "We had a security incident.

The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:\n\n* **Article 11** would create a \"link tax:\u201d Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees\u2014 pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit. \n* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law\u2019s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user\\-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.   \n\nThe unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe. \n\nLuckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm. \n\nJulia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for [an AMA on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/). In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!\n\nAs a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an [easy tool](https://act.openmedia.org/savethelink-call) to help you identify and call your MEP.\n\nHere are some things you\u2019ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP\u2019s office:\n\n* Share your name, location and occupation.\n* Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).\n* Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?\n* Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message\u2014your concern will still be registered.\n* Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human. \n\nPhone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!\n\nAnd be sure to let us know how it went!

In general, \\*these\\* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we\u2019re replacing are no longer available \\(RIP redditmade and reddit.tv\\), we\u2019ve created a more [robust API process](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), and we\u2019ve launched [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/)!\n* **European data protection law.**  Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation \\(GDPR\\). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as \u201cUpdates to our Privacy Policy\u201d and \u201cReminder: Important update to our Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policy.\u201d  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you\u2019ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.\n* **Clarity.**  While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise \\(like the Copyright, DMCA &amp; Takedown section in the User Agreement\\), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy \\(e.g., \u201cdon\u2019t mess with Reddit\u201d in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d in the content policy\\).\n\nOur work won\u2019t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I\u2019ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we\u2019ve built a [dedicated anti\\-evil team](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we\u2019re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we\u2019re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.  We appreciate the work you all have done to [responsibly report security vulnerabilities](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/whitehat) as you find them.\n\n**Note**: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.\n\nI know it can be [difficult to stay on top of](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/8hm7ak/this_visualized_design_shows_you_its_impossible/) all of these Terms of Service updates [\\(and what they mean for you\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8euz34/lpt_with_new_privacy_regulations_coming_soon_and/), so we\u2019ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.

And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it can be &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/8hm7ak/this_visualized_design_shows_you_its_impossible/\"&gt;difficult to stay on top of&lt;/a&gt; all of these Terms of Service updates &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8euz34/lpt_with_new_privacy_regulations_coming_soon_and/\"&gt;(and what they mean for you)&lt;/a&gt;, so we\u2019ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.

That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let\u2019s remind them that we\u2019re watching!\n\n[Today, you\u2019ll see sites across the web go on \u201cRED ALERT\u201d](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign) in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \\(both of \u2018em!\\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort [here](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/).\n\nWe\u2019re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in r/politics today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!\n\nFinally, seeing [the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you\u2019re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator\u2019s office told you when you called them up.

That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let\u2019s remind them that we\u2019re watching!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign\"&gt;Today, you\u2019ll see sites across the web go on \u201cRED ALERT\u201d&lt;/a&gt; in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that &lt;a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered\"&gt;Orangered&lt;/a&gt; Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in &lt;a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\"&gt;calling your Senators&lt;/a&gt; (both of \u2018em!) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality.

Maybe you\u2019re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator\u2019s office told you when you called them up.

This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.\n\nFirst, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don\u2019t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \\(You\u2019ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\\) \n\nWe also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \\(Montagna\\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \\(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \\(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\\).\n\nI\u2019d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I\u2019ve mentioned before that we\u2019re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we\u2019re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:\n\nIn my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I\u2019d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: \n\n* 70&amp;#37; \\(662\\) had zero karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(8\\) had negative karma\n* 22&amp;#37; \\(203\\) had 1\\-999 karma\n* 6&amp;#37; \\(58\\) had 1,000\\-9,999 karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(13\\) had a karma score of 10,000\\+\n\nOf the 282 accounts with non\\-zero karma, more than half \\(145\\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation\u2014all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.\n\nAnd as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. \n\nTo give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.\n\nWe still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust &amp; Safety and Anti\\-Evil teams are working. It\u2019s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.\n\nWe know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading.

Today, Reddit\u2019s Engineering team invites you \u201cunder the hood\u201d look at how we\u2019re giving a long overdue update to Reddit\u2019s core stack.\n\nSpoiler: There\u2019s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we\u2019ll get through it together.\n\n**History and Journey**\n\nFor most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit\u2019s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days\u2014a [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \\(aka \u201cr2\u201d\\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.\n\nGiven Reddit\u2019s historically tiny eng team \\(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\\), our code wasn\u2019t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:\n\n* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): \"For a while now, \u2018The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist\u2019 has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.\u201d\n* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): \"After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \\(unsurprisingly\\) part of the code review process is to use \u2018git blame\u2019 to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \\(one of the more core JS files we had\\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being \u2018full stack\u2019 to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \\(and depressed\\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \\(a senior web dev\\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.\"\n* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): \u201cI worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team\u2019s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you\u2019ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \\(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\\), and new features \\(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.\n\nEnter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit\u2019s desktop code to date.\n\n**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**\n\nTwo years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \\(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn\u2019t want to outright break.\n\nWhen we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble\u2014with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit\u2019s 330 million monthly users.\n\nBut above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase \"developer velocity,\" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more \"git blame\" for decade\\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.\n\n**The New Tech Stack**\n\nThese are the three main components we use in the redesign today:\n\n* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.\n* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.\n* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\\-related bugs, has good built\\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \\(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)\n\n**Just the Beginning**\n\nWith our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We\u2019ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we\u2019ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \\(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\\). So far, we\u2019ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of \\~20 features and 200\\+ bugs per month.\n\nWe know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items \\(like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts\\), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign\u2014and because of our engineers\u2019 work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish\u2014we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn\u2019t want to use it.\n\n[Thank you](https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif) to everyone who\u2019s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.\n\nPS: [We\u2019re still hiring.](https://about.reddit.com/engineering/) :\\)", "author_fullname": "t2_168ycd", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "And Now a Word from Reddit\u2019s Engineers\u2026", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/announcements", "hidden": false, "pwls": 1, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_8830oa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "ups": 7741, "domain": "self.announcements", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7741, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1522343395.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1522343341.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 1, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you may have heard, we\u2019ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year.

I let the reviewee (a senior web dev) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis\"&gt;u/ketralnis&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cI worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.\u201d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Reddit&amp;#39;s engineering team has grown &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team\u2019s current size, we&amp;#39;re finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you\u2019ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements (like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons), and new features (like inline images in text posts and submit validation). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit\u2019s desktop code to date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages (Javascript on the client and Python on the server). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn\u2019t want to outright break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble\u2014with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit\u2019s 330 million monthly users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase &amp;quot;developer velocity,&amp;quot; or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more &amp;quot;git blame&amp;quot; for decade-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Tech Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type-related bugs, has good built-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. (You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas\"&gt;u/nr4madas.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just the Beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We\u2019ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we\u2019ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users (well, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/\"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; steady number...&lt;/a&gt;). So far, we\u2019ve shipped over 150 features, we&amp;#39;ve fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we&amp;#39;re moving forward at a rate of ~20 features and 200+ bugs per month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items (like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign\u2014and because of our engineers\u2019 work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish\u2014we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn\u2019t want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif\"&gt;Thank you&lt;/a&gt; to everyone who\u2019s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=\"https://about.reddit.com/engineering/\"&gt;We\u2019re still hiring.&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?format=png8&amp;s=47d9c2d0d3f3e88b2e65fc7af565027e1bc0d77f", "width": 400, "height": 225}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=2bbb545c6ec794e65c1102becab7051f1bf2f67a", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=2c45fcfbc0e38196af746b6b7fc031faa6377a38", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=15d0e47a207c26d70687adfb19e6edb97c51b6b4", "width": 320, "height": 180}], "variants": {"gif": {"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?s=87bd66d5a3d864dc379d8a61cbee6912fb8eb020", "width": 400, "height": 225}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=f1bdade462234fe6278d08252815d1612e578731", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=269ebbcd61a019cc6b7e9f4e3cd974f31045f6b1", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/1cThe8Gvyfiz8peg10V1NlHWFzOylvSP1tsIP8GPF_w.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=a59ae03431f0892c26a8261016c741ed4c190098", "width": 320, "height": 180}]}}, "id": "vSLAdctAWMWgQ4LVWqAiDl45cZlFqcYpWKoUwVJ7S0A"}], "enabled": true}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": "admin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ij", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "8830oa", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anand-m", "num_crossposts": 1, "num_comments": 2886, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "house_only", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/announcements/comments/8830oa/and_now_a_word_from_reddits_engineers/", "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8830oa/and_now_a_word_from_reddits_engineers/", "subreddit_subscribers": 36263508, "created_utc": 1522343341.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "announcements", "selftext": "Hello All\u2014\n\nWe want to let you know that we have made a new addition to our [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) forbidding transactions for certain goods and services.

Today, we\u2019re going to try something a little different. We\u2019d like to take all of you on a field trip, [to the Museum of Reddit](https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png)!\n\nWhen we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past \\(on Reddit [and other sites](http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png)\\). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.\n\n**Trippin\u2019 Through Time**\n\nWhen Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny\u2019s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit\u2019s front page [looked like this](https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg&amp;s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456).\n\nIn the site\u2019s early days, [u/spez](/user/spez) and [u/kn0thing](/user/kn0thing) played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests [by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks](http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html), and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned\\-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/).\n\nAs Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. \\(Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...\\)\n\nThey launched commenting. \\(The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).\\) They recoded the entire site [from Lisp to Python](https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg&amp;s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217). They added [limits on the lengths of post titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/z9yk/reddit_headlines_have_been_getting_longer_and/). And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit\u2019s biggest change to date: [user\\-created subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/).\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it [wasn\u2019t without controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/). In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and [argued](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/) [passionately](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/) [against](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/) [subreddits](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/). \\(Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched [our first desktop redesign](https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/), which received its share of [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/), [bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/), and [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/) reviews.\\)\n\nDuring those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in\\-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user\\-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a [cumbersome URL trick](https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/) people used to make multireddits into [a supported feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/).\n\nThat approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we\u2019ve built in the years since then, like [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) \\(my first project as an admin\\), [video hosting](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/), [mobile apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/), [mobile mod tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/), [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/), [live threads](https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/), [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/), and [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/), to name a few.\n\n**What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!**\n\nThroughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:\n\n* You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.\n* The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.\n\nWith the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third\\-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like [set post requirements](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif) and [take bulk actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif) more easily.

Today, we\u2019re going to try something a little different. We\u2019d like to take all of you on a field trip, &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png\"&gt;to the Museum of Reddit&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past (on Reddit &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png\"&gt;and other sites&lt;/a&gt;). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trippin\u2019 Through Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny\u2019s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit\u2019s front page &lt;a href=\"https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg&amp;amp;s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456\"&gt;looked like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the site\u2019s early days, &lt;a href=\"/user/spez\"&gt;u/spez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/user/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt; played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html\"&gt;by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/\"&gt;Snoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. (Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They launched commenting. (The first comment, fittingly, was about how &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/\"&gt;comments are going to ruin Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.) They recoded the entire site &lt;a href=\"https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg&amp;amp;s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217\"&gt;from Lisp to Python&lt;/a&gt;. They added &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/z9yk/reddit_headlines_have_been_getting_longer_and/\"&gt;limits on the lengths of post titles&lt;/a&gt;. And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit\u2019s biggest change to date: &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/\"&gt;user-created subreddits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/\"&gt;wasn\u2019t without controversy&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/\"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/\"&gt;passionately&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/\"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/\"&gt;subreddits&lt;/a&gt;. (Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/\"&gt;our first desktop redesign&lt;/a&gt;, which received its share of &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/\"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/\"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/\"&gt;constructive&lt;/a&gt; reviews.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a &lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/\"&gt;cumbersome URL trick&lt;/a&gt; people used to make multireddits into &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/\"&gt;a supported feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we\u2019ve built in the years since then, like &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/\"&gt;image hosting&lt;/a&gt; (my first project as an admin), &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/\"&gt;video hosting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/\"&gt;mobile apps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/\"&gt;mobile mod tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/\"&gt;flair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/\"&gt;live threads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/\"&gt;spoiler tags&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/\"&gt;crossposting&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let&amp;#39;s Find Out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif\"&gt;set post requirements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif\"&gt;take bulk actions&lt;/a&gt; more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback (more on that in our next blog post about engineering!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like anything we\u2019ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we\u2019re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon.

Reddit is evolving!\n\nReddit is not a one\\-size\\-fits\\-all experience. It\u2019s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:\n\n* Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit\n   * [Give communities tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) that are simple, intuitive, and flexible\u2014for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.\n* Make our desktop experience more welcoming\n   * Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice \\(e.g., different viewing options: [Card](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) / [Classic](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) / [Compact](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif)\\) and familiarity to all users.\n* Design a foundation for the future\n   * Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.\n* Keep content at the forefront\n   * We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.\n\n# Asking Reddit\n\nAs we moved from setting high\\-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look\\-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It\u2019s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:\n\n* Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a \u201chamburger menu\u201d on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and [filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters](https://i.redd.it/1is6htgra3j01.gif).\n* Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts \\(aka \u201cCreate a post\u201d\\) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases.

We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we\u2019d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. \n\nThe debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions\u2014especially during an election year like this one. \n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cI already called my Congressperson last year, and we\u2019re still in this mess! What\u2019s different now?\u201d Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**\n\n# What is it?\n\nThe Congressional Review Act \\(CRA\\) is basically Congress\u2019s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC\u2019s order through a \u201cresolution of disapproval.\u201d This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC\u2019s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).\n\n# What\u2019s happening in Congress?\n\nNow that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! \n\n# What should I do?\n\nToday, we\u2019re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they\u2019re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.\n\nIf they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:\n\n\u201cMy name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I live in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I\u2019m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I\u2019d like to ask Senator/Representative\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC\u2019s repeal of net neutrality.\u201d\n\n# Pro tips:\n\n\\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. \n\n\\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you\u2019re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).\n\n\\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that.

We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we\u2019d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions\u2014especially during an election year like this one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cI already called my Congressperson last year, and we\u2019re still in this mess! What\u2019s different now?\u201d Three words: &lt;strong&gt;Congressional Review Act.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What is it?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is basically Congress\u2019s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC\u2019s order through a \u201cresolution of disapproval.\u201d This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC\u2019s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI\"&gt;a video explaining the process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What\u2019s happening in Congress?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only &lt;a href=\"https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#onemorevote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; away from the 51 it needs to pass! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What should I do?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, we\u2019re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on &lt;a href=\"https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/\"&gt;this scoreboard&lt;/a&gt;. If they\u2019re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy name is ________ and I live in ______. I\u2019m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I\u2019d like to ask Senator/Representative_______ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC\u2019s repeal of net neutrality.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Pro tips:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Be polite&lt;/strong&gt;. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU&lt;/strong&gt;. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you\u2019re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up &lt;a href=\"https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!&lt;/strong&gt; Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Don\u2019t give up.&lt;/strong&gt; The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish.

As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.\n\nFun fact: When Reddit first launched, user\\-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.\n\n# Features inspired by the community\n\n[**Image Flair - Emojis**](https://i.redditmedia.com/Tk7MR1_C8WtRpgrtnQfM4qziSIsS7q5S1lirkhcMlZo.png?s=048534b6d6837c5a0d2c708b34d2fe3f)\n\nGiving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like [r/baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball)'s team logo flair and [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW)'s faction icons. To make this process simpler, we\u2019re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.\n\n[**Submit Validation**](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif)\n\nModerators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren\u2019t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.\n\n[**Flair Filtering**](https://i.redditmedia.com/ERuv8BBJBhRL28_cexQVDulJ2q2djLR9tiSCoLmC7iw.png?s=22b5edba1b74e4e1ef604057907f7509)\n\nMany subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities. [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting, [r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop) uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we\u2019ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.\n\n**Sidebar**\n\nMany mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of [r/WholesomeMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeMemes) to [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA)'s schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes [text widgets](https://i.redd.it/7u6ttrufr6g01.png), [button widgets](https://i.redd.it/117hrvjx6af01.png), [image widgets](https://i.redd.it/uhg3r378s6g01.png), [a calendar widget](https://i.redd.it/t2l2jrhy6af01.png), [a related communities widget](https://i.redd.it/8kfygo3y6af01.png), and [a rules widget](https://i.redd.it/grx7kklsr6g01.png). But we\u2019re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.\n\n# Features inspired by 3rd-party tools\n\nCommunities themselves aren\u2019t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd\\-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite \\(RES\\).\n\n**Toolbox:** [**Bulk Mod Actions**](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif)\n\nModerating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third\\-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You\u2019ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.\n\n**RES:** [**Show All Images \\(aka Card View\\)**](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif)\n\nRES has enhanced Reddit\u2019s expandos \\(i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs\\) for years, and one of the most popular features has been \u201cshow all images\u201d \\(i.e., expand all the things!\\). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post\u2019s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.\n\n**RES:** [**User Info Cards** **\\(inline banning/muting\\)**](https://i.redd.it/q070hj0yv6g01.gif)\n\nWhen cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they\u2019ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user\u2019s stats \\(like account age and karma score\\) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio\u2014plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.\n\n**Toolbox:** [**Removal Reasons**](https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif)\n\nOver the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox\\-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we\u2019re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. \\(Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.\\)\n\n**Styling**\n\nToday it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. [Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn\u2019t work on mobile.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif) With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. \\(But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.\\)\n\nWith these new features, we're excited to say that [styling a community is much easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/). Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like [r/AskReddit](https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png), [r/CasualConversation](https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png), [r/Greenday](https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png), [r/ITookAPicture](https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png), and [r/NASCAR](https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png). We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.\n\n**Join the Redesign!**\n\nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews).", "author_fullname": "t2_ubcaq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day\u2026 here\u2019s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/announcements", "hidden": false, "pwls": 1, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_7xjt6g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "ups": 8437, "domain": "self.announcements", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8437, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1518630409.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 1, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, we &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/\"&gt;kicked off our blog series&lt;/a&gt; to take you behind the scenes of the redesign.

Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio\u2014plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toolbox:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removal Reasons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we\u2019re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. (Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. &lt;a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif\"&gt;Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn\u2019t work on mobile.&lt;/a&gt; With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. (But don&amp;#39;t worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With these new features, we&amp;#39;re excited to say that &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/\"&gt;styling a community is much easier&lt;/a&gt;. Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png\"&gt;r/AskReddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png\"&gt;r/CasualConversation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png\"&gt;r/Greenday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png\"&gt;r/ITookAPicture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png\"&gt;r/NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the Redesign!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews\"&gt;r/modnews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-lCkAZU3WI7lU1dacOCdPLwUiLlOqP_WSF1uvRqVkPY.png?auto=webp&amp;s=9ea58fec40be880707da0bd11f22c4e751a4a915", "width": 568, "height": 2174}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-lCkAZU3WI7lU1dacOCdPLwUiLlOqP_WSF1uvRqVkPY.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96f3cdcbe6017a9bc37b791f276304bfc459319", "width": 108, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-lCkAZU3WI7lU1dacOCdPLwUiLlOqP_WSF1uvRqVkPY.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98228a4879b511c084d0625a71fe5bcb61294658", "width": 216, "height": 432}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-lCkAZU3WI7lU1dacOCdPLwUiLlOqP_WSF1uvRqVkPY.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=462585c91986799c842410b0ac5026760b8d7272", "width": 320, "height": 640}], "variants": {}, "id": "-lCkAZU3WI7lU1dacOCdPLwUiLlOqP_WSF1uvRqVkPY"}], "enabled": false}, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": "admin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ij", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "7xjt6g", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Amg137", "num_crossposts": 12, "num_comments": 1833, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "house_only", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/", "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/", "subreddit_subscribers": 36263508, "created_utc": 1518630409.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "after": "t3_7xjt6g", "before": null}}
